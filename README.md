#### IMPORTANT NOTE: 

ActiveMQ Transport for NServiceBus is not supported at this time by Particular Software. The code is available as-is, for legacy and community reference. 

For background, please refer to our [discussion group announcement regaring ActiveMQ support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/particularsoftware/activemq/particularsoftware/2QWOxQsgusw/Bl_Nw02FpsYJ).

Our recommendation at this time is to use either the MSMQ or SQL transports for your .NET systems and use straight HTTP integration to communicate with other platforms â€“ potentially using the NServiceBus Gateway for that.

Please [contact us](http://particular.net/support) if you have any questions or comments.
